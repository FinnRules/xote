Version 0.8.0 of xote (a little bit bugged rn so probably wait for a proper release of 0.9.0)

Installation instructions:

1. Download .zip off of github
2. Extract
3. Remove file "xote" from extracted files (which should be called xote-master)
4. Move just the file named "xote" into the "mods" file of Minetest
5. Configure your world and select xote to add it to your world
6. Wonder why on earth you wanted to run this garbo mod
